Challenge for the week of 11/09/2018

Alright everyone, congrats on surviving the first code golf challenge. At this point I expect that you are all hardened veterans - so you should have no problem with this challenge. For this challenge you will be required to:


1. Convert a string to binary
2. Sum the bits of binary (see example 2)
3. Take the inverse square root of that sum

 01001000 01100101 01111001 00100000 01110100 01101000 01100101 01110010 01100101 00100000 01100101 01110000 01101001 01100011 00100000 01100110 01101111 01110010 01110100 01101110 01101001 01110100 01100101 00100000 01100111 01100001 01101101 01100101 01110010 01110011 00100001 -> 112 -> 0.09449111825

“q” -> 01110001 -> 4 -> .5

Accepting submissions in: Java or Python


How to submit:

You can submit your entry as a github link in this channel. I am requiring this because I think it is important for everyone to build a portfolio and because github has amazing syntax highlighting and version control. When you make your post to this channel, please included a current character count.


How to win:

The winner will be whoever implements a solution with the fewest characters. The code submitted must work in all use cases.


Prize:

The winner will receive a 3d printed trophy as a reminder of their accomplishment.
