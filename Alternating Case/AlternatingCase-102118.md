Challenge for the week of 10/07/2018

This is our first challenge so we are going to start off sort of easy. This week's challenge is to take a string input and output the string mockingly. For instance:


"hello world" ---> "HeLlO WoRlD"
"stop mocking me" ---> "StOp mOcKiNg mE"


In order to be considered a valid solution, the capitalization of characters must be alternating. You may assume the starting string is all lower case. You do not need to define a function with inputs and outputs, accept user input, or hard code a string. The existence of the string is implied and adding these things in increases character count to an extreme degree in some languages (looking at you, Java).


Valid Languages:

Accepting submissions in: Java, Python, C, C++, C#, Javascript, Haskell, Emoji Code, Ruby, and machine code.


How to submit:

You can submit your entry as a github link in this channel. I am requiring this because I think it is important for everyone to build a portfolio and because github has amazing syntax highlighting and version control. When you make your post to this channel, please included a current character count.


How to win:

The winner will be whoever implements a solution with the fewest characters. The code submitted must work in all use cases and run as is or with the addition of a function definition (still looking at you, Java) and or a hard coded string.


Prize:

The winner will receive a 3d printed trophy as a reminder of their accomplishment. The model for this trophy is super duper secret but guaranteed to be super duper dope.


Deadlines:

Everyone has until Sunday, October 21 to submit code and edit submissions.
